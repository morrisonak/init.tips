      <p>
        We recognize that Next.js and TypeScript don't solve every problem.
        While we encourage you to use the primitives they provide as often as
        you can, there are other tools that will help simplify and improve your
        developer experience.

      <h1 class="text-2xl mb-4 mt-8 font-semibold">UI Essentials</h1>

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">

          Tailwind CSS - for your styles

      <p>I hated the idea of Tailwind. Then I tried it.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="italic">It seems like Bootstrap.</span> I promise it is not
        Bootstrap. It enables a "flow state" in UI dev I didn't know was achievable.
        (and yes we used it here)
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-2xl mb-4 mt-8 font-semibold">Data Management</h1>

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"

        >
          React Query - for your client
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        This little library handles all your async React needs from data
        fetching to IO management. Hard to imagine doing React dev without it
        now. Might be able to replace your state management library too.

          Prisma.io - for your DB
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Prisma is to SQL what TypeScript is to JS. Never thought I'd love an
        ORM, but man, trust me on this one.

          tRPC - for defining and consuming APIs
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        tRPC delivers on GraphQL's promise of seamless client development
        against a typesafe server without all of the boilerplate. It's a clever
        abuse of TypeScript that provides an incredible dev experience.

          NextAuth.js - for authentication

      </h2>
      <p>
        Man this library makes auth easy. No ownership compromise, hooks up to
        your DB directly. So good that I ported two projects to Next to use it.

      <p>
        Vercel took the hell of web deployments and made it a set-and-forget
        GitHub integration. We've scaled to hundreds of thousands of users

        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        PlanetScale is the best "serverless database platform" I've used by far.
        Insane scale, great developer experience, fantastic pricing. If you're
        using sql (and hopefully Prisma), this is hard to beat.

        "Modern Heroku". Easiest way to get a real server up and running. If
        Vercel and PlanetScale aren't enough, Railway probably is. Point it at a
        GitHub repo and go.
