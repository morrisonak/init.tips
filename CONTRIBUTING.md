# Contributing to init.tips

## I Want To Add (Thing I Like)

We probably aren't going to accept PRs that add things you like to the website. This project is opinionated, and we're open to changing our opinions, but filing a PR here isn't the best place to convince us.

## What We're Looking For

This project is relatively simple, by design.

Contributions can be as simple as [typo fixes](https://github.com/TheoBr/init.tips/pull/3). The site's also a bit ugly, so we're open to a graphical improvement.
